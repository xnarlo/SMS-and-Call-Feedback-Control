Two Views: There are two separate views, one for sending SMS (sendsms.ejs) and one for making calls (callclient.ejs). Each view has its own form and button for the respective action.

Send SMS Button: When the "Send SMS" button in sendsms.ejs is clicked, the data sent to the server includes the SEND_SMS command followed by the phone number and message. The data format is SEND_SMS,<number>,<message>.

Make Call Button: When the "Make Call" button in callclient.ejs is clicked, the data sent to the server includes the MAKE_CALL command followed by the phone number. The data format is MAKE_CALL,<number>.

Arduino Parsing: The Arduino code reads the incoming data from the serial port. It checks whether the data starts with SEND_SMS or MAKE_CALL and then calls the appropriate function (sendSMS or makeCall) with the parsed phone number (and message for SMS).
